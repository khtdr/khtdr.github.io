      <description>Building your own live-reloading web server  Follow along and build your own automatically-refreshing web server, as shown here:   This setup assumes you know and use Node and NPM  You are editing HTML, CSS, and Javascript by hand, because you like it. You&amp;#39;ve had some of that hot-reloading goodness before, and you want it now, too.
 You don&amp;#39;t feel like spending the weekend reading Webpack docs, so you decide that it should only take a few dozen lines of Javascript, at most, to roll your own.</description>
