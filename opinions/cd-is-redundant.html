  <p>
  Tell me, if I type the name of a directory at the command line, what should
  happen?

  <p>
  What actually happens?

  <p>
  If I type <var>~</var>, <var>./name</var>, or <var>name/</var>, then
  bash recognizes the explicit reference to a directory, and confirms that,
  yes, that is a directory. Thanks bash.

  <p>
  If I type something that happens to be a directory, but is not explicit (ex:
  .ssh with no trailing slash), then bash tells me it cannot find that command.

  <p>
  What about other files? What if I type the name of a file instead of a
  directory?

  <p>
  Like directories, it depends what you type. If I'm in my home directory
  and I type <var>.bashrc</var>, it tells me that it cannot find that command. Much like
  when I typed an implicit directory name. It tried and failed to run a command.

  <p>
  But what if I'm more explicit and type <var>./.bashrc</var>? Then bash displays the
  error, <var>'Permission denied'</var>.

  <p>
  That's not the same behavior as with directories. It <em>should</em> have
  said that the file exists. Like it said the directory exists.

  <p>
  But of course, we know better. A file can be exectuable, and when I type
  the name of it, it will be executed. If it is not executable, then I don't
  have permission to execute it.

  <hr />

  <p>
  So files and directories are both executable. Well, directories are
  'searchable'. But the bit that sets this flag is the same: <var>x</var>.

  <p>
  If a file has the executable bit set, it is considered executable and can be
  run by typing the name.

  <p>
  If a directory has the exectuable bit set, then it is considered searchable
  and typing its name confirms its existence.

  <p>
  Wait... the existence is confirmed, but the return status code is 126,
  clearly indicating a failure of some kind!

  <hr />

  <p>
  Alright, enough of the build up. If I type the name of a directory,
  <strong>take me there please</strong>. <em>There is nothing else I could have
    meant</em> by typing the name of the directory. What else could I possible
  want than to go home when I type <var>~</var>.

  <p>
  This is what the <a href="http://fishshell.com/">fish shell</a> does. I use
  it wherever I can.

  <p>
  When I find myself using bash, I repeatedly type the destination directory
  name, only to be frustrated when things aren't doing what I assumed.

  <hr />

  <h6>riddle for the insomniacs</h6>

  <p>
  Is there a way to trap status codes in bash, similar to how we can trap
  signals? If so, I can't find it. If you know, <em>please</em> tell me.
