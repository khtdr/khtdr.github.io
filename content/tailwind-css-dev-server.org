Example output while running dev-server, shown here: [[/img/sample-logs.png]]

* Features
  - No "transpiling" configuration is needed (or used).
  - No build tools need to be set up.
  - Tiny reactive web server: ~115 lines of code with lots of comments.
  - Minimal dependencies:
    - =chalk= for color,
    - =socket.io= for *server* <---> *browser* communication,
    - and =tailwindcss= of course.
  
* Installation
Clone the GIT repository, and install the dependencies.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/khtdr/tailwind-dev-server.git
cd tailwind-dev-server
yarn
#+END_SRC

* Running
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
yarn start
#+END_SRC

Then open your browser to: http://localhost:8080

* Development

Edit any of the following entry point files:
 - [[https://github.com/khtdr/tailwind-dev-server/blob/master/index.html][./index.html]]
 - [[https://github.com/khtdr/tailwind-dev-server/blob/master/style.css][./style.css]]
 - [[https://github.com/khtdr/tailwind-dev-server/blob/master/tailwind.js][./tailwind.js]]

Changes will be recompiled and automatically refreshed in your browser. Errors will be displayed in the server output.

Create any additional HTML files as needed, using [[https://github.com/khtdr/tailwind-dev-server/blob/master/index.html][./index.html]] as a starting-point reference.

* Building
If you like what you see and want to save it and use it, run:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
yarn build
#+END_SRC

And now you can use your newly-built =./tailwind-bundle.css= stylesheet however you like.
